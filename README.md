Python Debugger project
-----------------------
A simple Python script that implements a custom debugger with the ability to set breakpoints, watch variables, and print local variable information during the execution of a Python program. This debugger allows you to pause the execution of your code at specific points, inspect variable values, and step through the code interactively.

Features:
---------
Set Breakpoints: Pause the program's execution at specific lines.
Watch Variables: Track the value of specific variables during execution.
Interactive Debugging: Pause execution and inspect variables when a breakpoint is hit.
Customizable: Easily set breakpoints and watched variables to suit your needs.

Requirements:
------------
Python 3.x
